                <li>
                    <p>Place a marker at the bottom of the TLC chamber. Use a cross as the marker and ensure one arm of the cross has an arrow pointing in a specific direction.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Open the camera app on your smartphone and switch to pro mode.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Position your phone on the chamber window at the top of the chamber. Rotate the phone so that the top border of the phone aligns with the direction of the arrow on the marker.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ensure the phone remains stationary during photo capture to avoid distortion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Always take photos using consistent pro settings on your camera app to ensure uniform results.</p>
